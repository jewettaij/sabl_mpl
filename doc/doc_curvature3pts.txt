## curvature3pts.py

A crude command line utility which reads the coordinates of 3 points,
finds the circle which passes through them, and returns the center
and the radius of that circle.

Since this might be useful to the same audience that would use "sabl.py",
I decided to included it as a simple stand-alone program.

## Usage

   curvature3pts.py < coordinates.txt

## Details

This program reads a text file from the standard input in multi-column
format, with N numbers on each line delimited by spaces. (Usually N=2 or 3.)
This file should contain exactly 3 lines (corresponding to the 3 points
on the circle).

This program works in an arbitrary number of dimensions.
(The number of dimensions is specified by the number of columns in the file.)
