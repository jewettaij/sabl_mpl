"sabl_mpl.py" is a hacky spline drawing program which uses the matplotlib gui.  It was intended to make it convenient to repetitively measure distances, angles, and curvature of objects in an image manually.  It requires python and matplotlib to be installed in advance.

Images showing how to use it are located in the "docs" directory, as well as detailed usage and installation instructions.
